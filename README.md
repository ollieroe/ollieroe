### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ollie a Web Developer. I have an eclectic interest in most things but anything, tech, fitness, travel, adventure and environmental are my focus at the mintue. 

The languages I currrently use include Javascript, HTML and CSS and completed the HyperionDev Web Developement course and currently working my way through the freeCodeCamp full stack developer curriculum. I am eger to learn more as I progress in my web development skills and looking forward to creating new projects or helpig build new features. 

I am currently working on a website that focuses on building a sustainable and more enjoyable side to being healthy and fit. It will focus less on workings and training regimes and more on consistency and active movement, whatever that entails for each person. 

I am continuing my personal development through greater learning with React, SCSS, and other front-end frameworks and technologies.

My background is an Advanced Podiatrist in the NHS with a Masters in Podiatric Surgery, with a foundation degree in Sport, Health and Exercise Science. I have ample knowledge how to research and the ability to learn qucikly and adopt new skills into practice quickly.
